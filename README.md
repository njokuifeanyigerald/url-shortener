# url-shortner
a url shortener built with django
## Built By BopGeek

<!-- Project URL: https://urlshortner-django.herokuapp.com/ -->

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web that enables the Uniform Resource Locator to be made considerably shorter and still direct to the desired page. This is done by using a redirect path to a web page that has a long URL.

The project is developed using Django for backend and HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for frontend. 

## Usage
When the user enters the link, a short link will appear. Use clipboard emote to copy the link. The link will redirect you to the original link. 

<!-- It has been deployed on Heroku. If you want then you can buy a domain and connect it with the Heroku as well. This will shortner the link even more.  -->
